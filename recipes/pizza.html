    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's my favourite recipe for a flavourful and crispy pizza that doesn't need to rise very long and always delivers. The recipe is for two medium sized pizzas</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>350 grams wheat flour (<i>Tipo 00</i> works best)</li>
        <li>7 grams dried yeast </li>
        <li>230 milliliters lager beer (Alcohol-free works perfect, it's about the flavour!)</li>
        <li>5 grams of salt</li>
        <li>40 milliliters extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>200 milliliters good quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>80 grams mozzarella, diced into small cubes</li>
        <li><em>Optional</em>: there's no rules in pizza, go nuts on your favourite toppings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, blend flour, yeast, and salt. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the beer and olive oil. Mix well, first with a spoon, then with your hands, until you have a malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into two buns, cover them with a wet cloth, then set aside to raise for at least one and a half hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven at 250&#8451. In the meantime, shape the two buns into pizzas onto some parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, then the mozzarella and other topping of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizzas in the oven for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Buon appetito!</li>
    </ol>
